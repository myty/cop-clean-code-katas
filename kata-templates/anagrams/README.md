# Anagram Kata

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different
word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. here are
some example anagrams

- `a gentleman` can be arranged to spell `elegant man`
- `Clint Eastwood` can be arranged to spell `old west action`
- `santa` can be arranged to spell `satan`

## The Challenge

given a file containing one word per line, print out all the combinations of
words that are anagrams; each line in the output contains all the words from the
input that are anagrams of each other

If you run this on the word list you should find 20683 sets of anagrams (a total
of 48162 words)
